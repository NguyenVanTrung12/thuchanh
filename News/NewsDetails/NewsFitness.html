          <b>1. Sports are both fun and inclusive.</b>
          <p>-Exercise and physical activity are fun, with the opportunity to relax, enjoy the outdoors, or simply engage in activities that make you happy. 
            Physical activity can also help you connect with family or friends in a fun social environment.

          </p>
          <p>- Exercise not only helps fight disease, it also creates a stronger heart – the most important muscle in the body. That makes exercise – and activities of daily living – feel easier.

          </p>
          <p>-Your heart and cardiovascular system will work more efficiently. Less plaque will build up in your heart. Your heart will become a more efficient pump. And as your heart gets stronger,
             it pumps more blood with each beat, so your resting heart rate will be lower.</p>

          <b>3. Relieve stress - improve brain</b>
          <p>
          <p>
            - Stress is one of the reasons that reduces the quality of your life. Therefore, preventing or relieving anxiety and sadness in the inner world is very necessary. According to doctors, in addition to entertainment, going to the gym is also a method to help you overcome pressure, tension and balance your mental life. 
          </p>
          <p>
           - In addition, maintaining a gym routine also helps you maintain clarity as well as improve the functions that the brain performs. In fact, when exercising, your heart rate will increase, while promoting the transport of oxygen and blood to the brain. 
           Thanks to that, the brain is stimulated and creates conditions to produce more hormones to promote the development of cells around the brain. 
          </p>
          <p>
           - Some doctors share that when you work out hard, you can reduce the risk of changes in the structure of your brain. Meanwhile, if the brain changes too much, it can increase the risk of some mental illnesses, typically Alzheimer's or schizophrenia. In addition, the gym is also a factor that helps the process of transporting blood to the brain more smoothly to improve memory and maintain your health.
